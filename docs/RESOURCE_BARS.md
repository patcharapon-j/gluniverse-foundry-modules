# Resource Bars

Replaces Foundry's canvas token bars with a shader-drawn HUD. System-agnostic
at the core, with a PF2e layer for temp HP and raised shields.

Feature id `resource-bars`, setting prefix `rb.`, i18n `GLRB.*`.

## Why a shader

Foundry draws its bars as `PIXI.Graphics` rectangles, re-tessellated on every
refresh. That form cannot hold a gradient, a bevel, a per-frame animation or a
gloss without redrawing geometry, which is why the stock bars look the way they
do. One quad and a fragment shader makes all of that free, and makes "animates
every frame" cost nothing extra.

The visual language is Etched Glass materials on *Honkai: Star Rail* geometry —
a consistent shear, layers separated by air rather than welded into one frame, a
flat high-key fill lit by a single hard specular, and asymmetric furniture at
the ends. The palette is entirely the suite's own; the gold is
`PALETTE.signalPale`.

## The pipeline

```
bar meshes ──► one container on canvas.interface ──► bloom filter ──► screen
                 (world coords, never token children)
```

Bars live in **one** container, not as children of each token. Three reasons:

1. The bloom is **one** filter over that container. A filter on a token
   allocates a render texture per token per frame — in a forty-token combat
   that is the most expensive thing this feature could do.
2. Tokens rotate; bars must not. World space means never counter-rotating.
3. One container is one place to hide everything.

`bloom.mjs` runs threshold → blur H → blur V → composite. **PIXI's filter
textures are 8-bit**, so everything the shader emits above 1.0 is clamped before
the filter sees it; the threshold therefore sits below 1.0 and works on what
survived. The preview harness renders to RGBA16F and can threshold above 1.0,
so it is strictly more accurate than the shipped path. If a future Foundry
offers a float filter target, raising the threshold is the only change needed.

## Units, and the one subtle thing

`core/glsl.mjs`'s prelude measures everything against `uTexel` — one device
pixel in UV units, where UV is relative to the quad's **width**. That is correct
for the square quads of the token overlay it was written for. A resource bar is
routinely 8:1, so a y-distance clamped against `uTexel` is clamped against the
wrong pixel size.

So the shader works in **`p`**: an isotropic space where one unit is the bar's
height, x scaled by `uAspect`. It restates the prelude's *policy* — the same
imported `GL_BAND` / `GL_EDGE` / `GL_FADE_*` thresholds — in that space via
`px`, one device pixel in p units.

**Anything meant to read as a hairline must be defined in `px`, not in p units.**
A fixed `0.036` is 2.1 device pixels on a HiDPI display and 0.68 on an ordinary
one, where `rbDetail` correctly deletes it — so the feature silently disappears
for every player without a retina monitor, and no preview you run yourself can
show you that. `tools/resource-bar-check.mjs` pins it.

As in the prelude, `uTexel = 0` leaves every clamp inert: a missing uniform
degrades to the unfiltered look, never to a blank quad.

---

## Hot and cold

A bar that is not changing is **not ticked at all** — it keeps its last frame.
The ticker is attached only while at least one bar is hot, so a quiet scene
costs nothing and a scene where one creature is being hit costs one bar.

Under load, `SHED_ORDER` in `anim.mjs` gives effects up cheapest-first until the
rolling frame time is back inside budget. Every animated behaviour must appear
in that list; the check tool enforces it, so a new effect cannot be added that
never degrades.

---

## Permission

**The feature never shows more than `displayBars` already permits.** A GM who
has hidden a hostile's bars from players must not have that undone by a prettier
bar — and a leak here renders perfectly, raises nothing, and is discovered only
when a player says a number they should not have known.

`visibility.mjs` defers to Foundry's own computed `token.bars.visible` wherever
it exists, rather than reimplementing the rule, so it cannot drift from core.
The numeric readout is gated *more* narrowly still: a number is a more precise
disclosure than a length, so it can be turned down but never up.

Foundry's bars are suppressed with `renderable = false`, never `visible = false`
— `visible` is the permission answer this feature reads.

---

## Colour

The fill hue is a function of the health fraction, interpolated in **OKLab**: a
naive sRGB lerp from `--gl-good` to `--gl-signal` passes through a desaturated
olive that reads as "muddy green" rather than "getting worse". The forward
transform happens in JS at settings-change time; the shader pays only for the
inverse.

Three things sit off the ramp on purpose:

| | Colour | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Temp HP** | `cyanHot` | A buffer in front of your hit points |
| **Shield rail** | `cyan` | The same idea, so they read as related |
| **`bar2` rail** | `accent` | *Not* health. A half-full ammo counter must not be the same orange as a half-dead creature |

Health is encoded three ways that are not hue: segment position, the danger
hatch below the threshold, and the low-health frame pulse. A client-scoped
colour-blind-safe ramp (blue → orange) is offered as a fourth option.

## Validation

```bash
node tools/resource-bar-check.mjs
```

Zero problems required. It pins the uniform table against the GLSL *and* the JS
that writes it, that `uTexel = 0` stays inert, that the OKLab ramp still mirrors
`gl-tokens.css`, that no raw millisecond literal has escaped `TIMING`, that the
glyph atlas covers every character a run can emit, that the numeric readout is
inside the permission gate, that every animated behaviour is shed-able, that the
shear has one home, and that every detail gate still resolves at the reference
size. With Playwright present it also compiles the shader and checks that no
uniform was optimised away.

```bash
node tools/resource-bar-preview.mjs --out=.preview/bars.html
```

Writes a self-contained page that compiles the **real** shader in the browser's
own WebGL2 context and drives it with the **real** animation model. Serve it
(`node tools/preview-server.mjs`) rather than opening it as a file — a `file://`
page does not run its module script. `--artifact=` emits the same page without
the document wrapper, for publishing.

Neither tool can tell you how any of this looks on a real battlemap at a real
zoom. That needs a session.
